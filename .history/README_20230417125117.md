Till You Develop The Idea To start a Startup or To get a Patent . There is a chance fo the idea to get Stolen or to get Leaked to Public. In such Cases, If Someone Used your Idea and did something , There arises a Problem who Was the Real Owner of The Idea. In such Cases Our, IdeaNFT Helps....
# Solution:
### IdeaNFT helps such ideators by letting them add a "proof of idea" on the blockchain as a unique token without actually adding their idea in clear on it. When the ideator decides to publicise the idea, they can prove that they thought about the idea back (when they uploaded the proof) using the proof existing on the blockchain. 
       We provides two guarantees-

            When the ideator uploads the proof of idea, no-one can fetch the original idea just from the proof    stored on the blockchain. The idea is not stored in plain on the chain before it is being made public.  

            When the ideator tries to make their idea public, they cannot cheat by uploading a different idea than what they thought about back.

         These Make Our Idea Safe And Secure while also proves the Ownership.
